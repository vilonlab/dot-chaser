# dot-chaser
Built with Unity. An observational experiment investigating the retinotopic flow patterns generated by visual search + ground fixations during locomotion.

## Dev Notes: 2024-08-16

Eyeball position and rotation is recorded via the `EyeDataWriter.cs` script by its connection to the `Experiment Eye Gaze Right/Left` Game Object + the `ExperimentEyeGaze.cs` script. `ExperimentEyeGaze.cs` is a customized version of the `OVREyeGaze.cs` script, with only one line of code changed:

*Lines 87-89 of `ExperimentEyeGaze.cs`*
``` C#
// Trent Added 2024-06-06
    public event Action<Quaternion, Vector3> EyeRotationUpdated;
// end of Trent Added
```

### Critical to recording Eye Position: 

On the `Experiment Eye Gaze Right/Left` Game Objects, for the `ExperimentEyeGaze.cs` script, "World Space" needs to be selected for the `Tracking Mode` dropdown menu.
